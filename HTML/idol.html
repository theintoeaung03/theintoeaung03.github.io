    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
      Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São
      Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira,
      and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[10][11] He is the
      fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro,
      who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning
      woman,[12][13] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de
      Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club
      Andorinha.[14][15][16] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel
      da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[17] He has one
      older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia
      "Katia".[18] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan,
      whom his father was a fan of.[19] His mother revealed that she wanted to
      abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many
      children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[20][21]
      as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[22] Ronaldo grew up in
      an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his
      siblings.[23]
    </p>

      As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[24] where his
      father was the kit man,[14] and later spent two years with Nacional. In
      1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed
      him for a fee of £1,500.[25] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon
      to join Sporting CP's youth system.[25] By age 14, while struggling with
      his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his
      school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the
      ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his
      tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[26] to cease his education to focus
      entirely on football.[27][28] With a troubled life as a student[29] and
      living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete
      schooling beyond the 6th grade.[30][31] While popular with other students
      at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who
      he said had "disrespected" him.[27] One year later, he was diagnosed with
      tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing
      football.[32] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to
      cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart
      rate.[33] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure
      and resumed training a few days later.[34] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's
      mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official
      television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he
      hadn't become a professional football player.[35]

    <h2>Class career</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Sporting CP</b> <br />Ronaldo memorabilia at Sporting CP's museum At
      age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team
      manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[36] He
      subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
      under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a
      single season.[25] Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career,
      where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia on 1
      September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divisão B championship played in
      the Azores.[37] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the
      Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7
      October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[38] Over
      the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player
      to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan
      Laporta.[39] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo,
      met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible
      transfer.[40] Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to
      acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated
      United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August
      2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to
      Sporting for a year.[41] Having been impressed by him, the United players
      urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay
      Sporting £12.24 million[41] for what he considered to be "one of the most
      exciting young players" he had ever seen.[42] A decade after his departure
      from the club, in April 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him
      to become their 100,000th member.[43]
